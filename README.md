## <a name='Installation'></a>Set Up

SSH into your instance and let's begin setting up your streaming server, we'll first update the instance and then install our server application called NGINX

- update instance  
    ```sudo apt update```  <br />
    ```sudo apt upgrade``` <br /><br />
- install nginx - server application  
    ```sudo apt install nginx```<br /><br />
- check status  
    ```systemctl status nginx```  
    `ctl` + `c` to exit the server
    
If Nginx is running correctly, you will see a green Active status.

## <a name='receiver'></a>Build Your Receiver

Now, let's set up your receiver so your server can receive your live stream signal. 

- install nginx rmtp module, our receiver module  
    ```sudo apt install libnginx-mod-rtmp```<br /><br />
- restart nginxÂ   
    ```sudo systemctl restart nginx```<br />
    ```systemctl status nginx```  <br />
    `ctl + c` to exit

- configure nginx to receive stream  
    ```sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf```  
- copy and insert this code below at the bottom of the page<br />

```
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        chunk_size 4096;

        application live {
            live on;
            record off;
            # allow publish YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS;
            # deny publish all;

            # Setup HLS
            hls on;
            hls_path /mnt/hls/;
            hls_fragment 3;
            hls_playlist_length 60;
            #deny play all;
            allow play all;
        }
    }
}
```
- after pasting click `ctl` + `s` and then `ctl` + `x`<br />

```
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project
npm install
```
